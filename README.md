<h1>Quotes on Dev!</h1>
A WordPress theme for the Quotes on Dev project at Red Academy.

<h2>What was used for the project!</h2>
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, SCSS, Gulp, Wordpress, Visual Code Studio and Github.

Installation

1. Download me (don't clone me!)
   Then add me to your wp-content/themes directory.

2. Rename the quotesondev-starter-master directory
   Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate! Do you need starter or master in the directory name?

3. Install the dev dependencies
   Next you'll need to run npm install inside your theme directory to install the npm packages you'll need for Gulp, etc.

4. Update the proxy in gulpfile.js
   Lastly, be sure to update your gulpfile.js with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here] to the appropriate localhost URL).

And now would be a good time to git init :)

<h3> My thoughts on the project!</h3>
I thought that this project was easier to do than the Inhabitent project. However, I did have some issues with trying to get everything to work properly with CSS but that was my problem with how I organized everything.  Aside from that its an interesting project.
